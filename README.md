# Dependent Dropdowns

A website to demonstrate dependent dropdowns.

## Description

A single-page website where the page has 3 dropdown menus and an iframe. The second dropdown would be dependent on the selected value of the first dropdown. The third dropdown would be dependent on the value of the second dropdown. After all 3 dropdowns are selected, the user presses *Show Information* button. Depending on the value of the 3rd dropdown, the corresponding website would be displayed in the iframe.
